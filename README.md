Backup setup for devcamp workshop

We will most likely use CodeSandbox, but just in case of terrible network conditions - install this.

- 1. Ensure you have Node.js installed - LTS version (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- 2. Ensure you have yarn installed - (https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
- 3. Clone this repo
- 4. Yarn install
- 5. Yarn run dev (just to test it works)
